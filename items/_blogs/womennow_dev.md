WomenNow was founded by Paige Duffey and Maria Gabriela Waechter. Together they have over fourteen years of experience with ServiceNow and over fifty years experience being a woman, so you can bet they know what they are talking about.

Our purpose is to provide a spotlight for women in our community, and to support and enable women to achieve their goals. We believe that supporting womenâ€™s active involvement in the ServiceNow community will improve the ecosystem as a whole.

We welcome any woman who is involved with ServiceNow in any capacity, and even those wanting to join in the fun!

Our goal is to encourage and empower women to grow their careers in the ServiceNow ecosystem.
