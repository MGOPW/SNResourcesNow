<h2>Hello there!</h2>

Welcome to ResourcesNow. Ideally this will become your one-stop shop for helpful community and official resources. First you'll want to check out the menu on the left and look at the categories of items we have curated here. You can comment on each item, and if it's particularly helpful to you, you can give it a round of applause!

All credit for the idea goes to <a hsref="https://www.ashleysn.com/">Ashley Snyder</a>; thanks for letting me run wild with it.

Please stay tuned for more updates to this site and much more.
