<h2>Welcome</h2>

Thank you for your patience with us as we bring this site up to speed. The goal of ResourcesNow is to curate community resources that are available for people to use in all stages of their ServiceNow journey. Please bear with me as I try to get things updated, I will announce the official release of this site later tonight on <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealMGOPW">twitter</a>, the #community-bridging channel on <a href="https://sndevs.com">SNDevs.com</a>, <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/MGOPW">LinkedIn</a>, and anywhere else that I can reach.
<br />
<br />
If you want to contribute resources to be linked to here, please use <a href="https://forms.gle/7LagnbT9GRFAEBvJ9">this form</a>. I will do my best to keep the site updated with new things as they are submitted, and I will work for a better automatic way for the new resources to be added as they are approved in the future. 
<br />
<br />
Also please forgive the CSS formatting of the site. That is still very much WIP.

Welcome to ResourcesNow. Ideally this will become your one-stop shop for helpful community and official resources. First you'll want to check out the menu on the left and look at the categories of items we have curated here. You can comment on each item, and if it's particularly helpful to you, you can give it a round of applause!

All credit for the original idea goes to Ashley Snyder; thanks for letting me run wild with it.
